Assignment 1: Restaurant Finder (Part 2)

Description: 
	This program improves the restaurant finder program developed in part 1:
	-The quickSort algorithm is implemented to make the program run faster.
	-We can now scroll through more than 21 restaurants in the list view.
	-We can now choose a rating and display restaurants that are above it.
	-We can now choose the  sorting algotithm (ISORT, QSORT, or both) and  display the run time.
	-We can now view restaurants that are above a certain rating on the map.


Included Files:
	*a1part2.cpp
	*lcd_image.cpp (contains implementation of header file)
	*lcd_image.h (header file for drawing section of map on screen)
	*restaurant.cpp
	*restaurant.h
	*yegmap.cpp
	*yegmap.h
	*Makefile
	*README

Accessories:
	5x Wires
	1x JoyStick
	1x USB cable
	1x Arduino MEGA board
	1x LCD Display for Arduino
	1x SD card containing the map of Edmonton

Wiring Instructions:
	Arduino pin GND           <-->    Joystick pin GND
	Arduino pin 5V            <-->    Joystick pin +5V
	Arduino digital pin 53    <-->    Joystick pin  SW
	Arduino analogue pin A8   <-->    Joystick pin VRy
	Arduino analogue pin A9   <-->    Joystick pin VRx


Running Instructions:
	1) Make sure your Arduino is wired up correctly and connected to your laptop.
	2) Open the terminal and navigate to the correct program directory.
	3) Type in "make upload" to compile the program and upload it to the Arduino.
	4) Move the joystick to move the cursor around the map of Edmonton.
	5) Press the joystick button to display a list of nearest 21 restaurants with at least the curret rating near the cursorâ€™s current position.
	6) Select a restaurant from the list using the joystick.
	7) This will redisplay the map, with the selected restaurant at the centre of the screen.
	8) Touch the map on the screen to show all the restaurants with at least the current rating in the current section of the map.


Notes and Assumptions:
	* A special image of the map of Edmonton 2048x2048 named "yeg-big.lcd" is loaded onto a specially formatted microSD card which is inserted into the display.
	* Moving cursor over blue dots representing restaurants, erase them. Intended.
	* Touching map after changing rating does not remove previous blue dots. Intended.
